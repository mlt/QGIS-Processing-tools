That is two points in proximity may not necessary be related if a curvature is different. However since changes in curvature is orders of magnitude smaller than changes in spatial coordinates, we scale curvature before calculating \tEuclidean distance in 2+1D. Smaller multiplier puts more weight on spatial proximity, larger - on curvature.", "Original": "Original channel centerline", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Mikhail Titov"}
